Variability and degradation in RRAM devices in-
volve complex physical mechanisms that depend on the device,
environment and programming/read operation. The development
of solid and accurate compact models, ready to be used in
standard circuit simulators, requires the meticulous emulation
of this kind of non-ideal effects. In this work we present an
advanced approach for the emulation of complex variability
and degradation effects in SPICE compacts models. Without
requiring compiled components —such as Verilog-A or CMI
code— the proposed solution can be adapted to any kind of
memristor model providing full support to the emulation of
these intricate behaviors. Thorough experiments illustrate the
capabilities of the presented approach. There, we make use of
a physical SPICE model that emulates behavioral dependence
on the device cycling, simulation time and stress levels. After
applying the proposed techniques, we obtain an enhanced model
properly aware of the device’s non-ideal behavior.
